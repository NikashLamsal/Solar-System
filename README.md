## Solar System Project

This is a Python project that visualizes the Solar System using Pygame. The project implements the **Mid-Point Ellipse** and **Mid-Point Circle Algorithms** for drawing orbits and planets, with a looping technique to fill the color in planets. The project consists of two versions: a **static** version where everything is fixed in place, and a **dynamic** version where planets orbit the Sun, showcasing real-time motion.

### Purpose of this Project

* Visualize the solar system with interactive and educational elements.
* Learn and apply computer graphics concepts using Python and Pygame.
* Experiment with mathematical algorithms for drawing and motion.

### 1. Dynamic Solar System

The **Dynamic Solar System** adds real-time motion, where planets orbit the Sun in a more realistic, animated manner. The planets' velocities are calculated based on their orbital radii, providing a basic demonstration of orbital mechanics.

### 2. Static Solar System

The **Static Solar System** displays a fixed, non-moving arrangement of the Sun, planets, and their orbits. The planets are positioned at fixed distances from the Sun, with elliptical orbits drawn using the **Mid-Point Ellipse Algorithm**.
